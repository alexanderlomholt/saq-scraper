# SAQ Scraper

I wrote this web scraper in *March 2018* as part of a project where I needed to retrieve the name of every SAQ store in Montreal.

Additional info such as ids and addresses are also collected and used to make api calls to retrieve coordinates from the Google geocoder for each store location.
